# Adonis App

## Set Up

Right now there is only a front end. To get it started just run:
 - yarn
 - yarn start


## To Do:

The main things that need to be implemented right now are:
 - Set up back end to store profiles and workouts
 - Hook back end up with front end so it is operating off of the actual profile rather than static config
 - Update `Workout` page to be able to record reps on last set
 - Record results from a workout
 - Update `program` schema to include accessories
 - Create profile page that lets you set up your profile with preferences for Days/Week and which primary/auxiliary movements you're using as well as what your current max is
 - On `Home` page add a third module that shows your lift progression over time
